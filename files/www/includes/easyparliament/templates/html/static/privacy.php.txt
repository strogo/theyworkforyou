            <h3>What is your cookie policy?</h3>
            <p>We use cookies to save you from having to repeatedly sign in to
            the site, and also to remember your postcode. We may also use them
            to record if you've answered one of the survey questions we ask. The
            site will work with cookies disabled, but it won't be as good.</p>

            <h3>What are these survey questions?</h3>
            <p>In order to improve the site we're asking some questions to help
            us understand who uses the site and what they want. The answers are
            completely anonymous.</p>

            <h3>Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)</h3>
            <p>We use Google Analytics to collect information about how people
            use this site. We do this to make sure it&rsquo;s meeting its
            users&rsquo; needs and to understand how we could do it better.</p>

            <p>Google Analytics stores information such as what pages you visit,
            how long you are on the site, how you got here, what you click on,
            and information about your web browser.</p>

            <p>We have also enabled the Advertising Features of Google
            Analytics. In particular, we use <b>Demographics and Interest
            reporting</b> to identify trends in the types of users visiting our
            site, which may be used for internal reporting and improvement of
            the site content.</p>

            <p>In technical speak, this allows Google to collect data about your
            traffic via Google
            <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/types/">advertising
            cookies</a> and
            <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-identifier">anonymous
            identifiers</a>, in addition to data collected through a standard
            Google Analytics implementation. Regardless of the source of the
            data, we strictly adhere to
            <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2700409">Google&rsquo;s
            policy requirements</a> in our treatment of your data. We do not
            facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with
            non-personally identifiable information collected through any Google
            advertising product or feature.</p>
